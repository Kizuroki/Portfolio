# Portfolio
This is a newpaper-themed portfolio, highlighting my computer science/media work. It will contain a light and dark mode that can change when you press on the letter O of my last name (which is shown as a sun in the 'Daytime Edition' and a moon in the 'Nighttime Edition'. I am currently learning how to format sections on the website which is proving to be super difficult considering every section is randomly organized but must fit cohesively against one another. The entire homepage will contain and sections: about me, knowledge, skills, experience, and contact info. I will create create icons that will take you seperately to my resume, github, and linkedin. Furthermore, I will make it to where you can change the font to what fits you best for accessibility purposes.
